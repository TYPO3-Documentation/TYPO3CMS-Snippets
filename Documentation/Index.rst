TYPO3 Snippets, Tips and Howtos
===============================

Don't hesitate to contact us on `Slack <https://typo3.org/community/teams/documentation>`__
in the channel #typo3-documentation.


What is a "Snippet"?
====================

.. Code snippets? Yes!
   -------------------

As understood here a snippet is some kind of code extract with explanation
that shows how to accomplish some kind of task. It doesn't have to stick to a
special form. The existing snippets show give an impression of what is working
well.

.. A useful pointer to external information? Yes!
   ----------------------------------------------

**One important characteristic is:** It is the *personal* contribution of the
author. That is: It is not "official" information. The TYPO3 documentation team
doesn't check or judge whether the solution given works or is recommended.
Instead, anybody in the community is invited to give feedback.

.. Underlining the fact that snippets contain **personal** advice authors are
   explicitely invited to publish "snippets" that mainly serve as a pointer to an
   useful external source of knowledge like a blogpost.

.. Your personal Howto? Yes, please!
   ---------------------------------
   And, if you have some kind of **howto** that you have come across: Please
   publish those steps here as well.

.. Please contribute
   =================
   #. Go to the page with the latest snippet
   #. Use the usual "Edit me on Github" workflow and add your snippet at the top.
   #. Send a PULL REQUEST
   #. Provide at least title, name, date, keywords, description and code.
   #. Don't worry: The documentation team will help you with the details of
      text markup.
   #. In general: While it's nice to have a similar structure for the snippets
      this is not a requirement any more. So you may have *several* descriptions
      and code passages in your contribution.
   #. You have collected a whole bunch of snippets and would like to have them
      added? Get in contact with the `TYPO3 documentation team!
